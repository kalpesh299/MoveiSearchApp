# Event Handling and Asynchronous Programming

This repository contains code that demonstrates the following key functionalities in a web application:

## Event Handling

The application listens for user interactions, such as button clicks and form submissions, using the `addEventListener()` method. This ensures that user actions trigger the appropriate functions.

## Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous operations, particularly API calls, are handled gracefully using `async` and `await`. This ensures that the application remains responsive and provides a smooth user experience even during potentially time-consuming tasks.

## HTTP Requests

The application communicates with a server using the Fetch API .


## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements, such as `if` statements, are employed to selectively execute code based on the results of API calls. This allows the application to display appropriate success or error messages to the user.
